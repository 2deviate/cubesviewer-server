  * Saving / sharing: how will it work?
    - share to shared folder, like currently
    - description / notes to be shown below, markdown/js?
    - mutable views
    - share id (+name?)  - if sharing id, users with no access to cv database could not view it if shared externally?
    - embed how? html? script? url? point to id?
    - single page share url: single page, view mode (editable + view in studio, if appropriate as per settings)
